        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegemite</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Wheat Bread</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Cut a slice of bread from the loaf.</li>
          <li>If the bread is more than a day old, then toast the bread until toasted to your satisfaction.</li>
          <li>Scoop some Vegemite from the bottle and spread it around the bread slice. Continue until the Vegemite mostly covers the bread slice</li>
          <li>This is the important part, the art of Vegemite: Take a bigger than usual (but not too big) scoop of butter and DONT SMEAR IT, rather lay it across the bread slice quickly.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Make sure not to smear the Vegemite or spread it around so it blends in.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Enjoy your warm slice of Vegemite. Eat Quickly because the butter may start to melt!</li>
        </ol>
